# PLAY NOW: [Elysium Hunters](https://hannah-sloan.github.io/Elysium-Hunters/)



## What Is This?

You fly around in a spacefaring bucket of bolts doing odd-jobs for odder folk. Whether bounty hunters or couriers each job is as easy to fail as it is to complete and you somehow always end up with just enough creds to relax in your ship as you travel to the next space station for your next mission. There is hope though. Elysium. Some say its utopia, some say its immortality, others say its a weapon. The only thing known for sure is the rumors started the same time the aliens showed up. Dangerous xenos roam the galaxy infesting space stations and bombarding the cyberpunk streets of earth. Earth's Mecha Defense Force has held them off for now but the war is a losing battle. Good thing your contact has a lead on Elysium, and you just filled up your hyper-tank.
