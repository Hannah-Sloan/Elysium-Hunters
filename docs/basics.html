			<h1>THE BASICS</h1>
				<p><em>This section is a <b>primer</b> to tabletop role-playing games. If you've played before you can <b>skip</b> this section. Many other rulebooks contain well written basics sections which can be used instead of or in conjunction to this section. I recommend Cyberpunk Red - VIEW FROM THE EDGE and Dungeons and Dragons 5e Player's Handbook - INTRODUCTION.</em> </p>

				<h2>How to play</h2>
					<p><b>Elysium Hunters</b> is a role-playing game played using your imagination. You play with friends, 5 people is ideal but you can find a way to play with any number of people. <b>One of you</b> takes on a special role, the role of the <em>Game Master</em>. The rest of you play <em>Player Characters</em>. </p>
					<p>​    <b>Game Master:</b> Abbreviated as <em>GM</em>. The Game Master <b>plays the world</b> of Elysium Hunters. They <b>present</b> the fictional environments, <b>and play</b> the <em>non-player characters</em>. They also act as a sort of <b>referee</b>, a neutral arbitrator of the rules: <b>helping</b> <em>players</em> understand how they work and using them in <b>uncertain moments</b> to determine what happens.</p>
					<p>​    <b>Player:</b> Any person playing who is not the <em>Game Master</em>. When the game mentions the <em>players</em> it is not referring to the <em>Game Master</em>. It is important to note that the GM is a player too. They invest their imagination and energy to create an engaging adventure and <b>everyone at the table deserves to enjoy the game.</b></p>
					<p>​    <b>Player Character:</b> Abbreviated as <em>PC</em> . Each <em>player</em> controls one fictional characters that they <em>role-play</em>, you decide what your character does and <b>imagine</b> what they are thinking and feeling. A good <em>player</em> allows their character's wants, personality and flaws to inform that character's relationships and actions. A good <em>player</em> is brave enough to allow themselves to <b>imagine, for the duration of the game, that their character is real.</b></p>
					<p>The <em>players</em> and <em>game master</em> engage in a <b>dialogue</b>: the players describing what they do and the GM describing what happens. Whenever you are uncertain about what happens in the fiction you consult the rules. This back and forth is what makes up a <em>session</em>. A typical session lasts <b>4 hours</b> (with lots of breaks!) but the ideal session length is the duration that <b>works best for your group</b>. Many sessions each continuing the same story are what make a <em>campaign</em> should your group want to play a long story. Some campaigns can even last for <b>years</b> in the real world!</p>

				<section id="rule-0">
				<h2>Rule 0</h2>
					<p>The most important rule is that this game is yours. Don't be afraid to bend, break, dismantle, or tweak the rules found here. They exist to serve <b>you</b> not the other way around. You should ignore them whenever it makes your game better.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="dice">
				<h2>Dice</h2>
					<p>Elysium Hunters uses <b>polyhedral dice</b>. You can usually find physical sets in game stores. You can also use online tools to generate a random number. The rules often ask you to roll dice and consult the results. Here is the notation of what dice to roll and how to interpret them</p>
					</section>
					<section id="dice-notation">
					<h3>DICE NOTATION</h3>
						<p>​    <b>Dice Size:</b> Is denoted by the letter <em>d</em> followed by the number of sides on the dice. <em>example: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20</em>.  So a d20 refers to a 20-sided die.</p>
						<p>​    <b>Multiple Dice:</b> The number of dice is denoted by a number <b>before</b> the <em>d</em>. You should roll all the dice and then <b>add the results together</b>. <em>example: 3d6</em> means to roll <b>3</b> six-sided dice and add the results together.</p>
						<p>​    <b>Modifiers:</b> A number is sometimes added or subtracted to the roll denoted as <em>+ or - (number)</em> after the roll. <em>example: 3d6+2, 3d6+TODO MODIFIER</em>. Modifiers might be variable, such as <em>TODO MODIFIER</em>. In some cases a modifier might be negative which will take away from the result of your roll.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="percentile-roll">
					<h3>Percentile Roll</h3>
						<p>TODO if any are introduced to the game. Otherwise I can remove.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="advantage-and-disadvantage">
					<h3>Advantage and Disadvantage</h3>
						<p>Sometimes a <em>d20</em> roll is granted <em>Advantage</em> or <em>Disadvantage</em>. <em>Advantage</em> is a positive benefit, make a success <b>more</b> likely and <em>Disadvantage</em> is a negative benefit, make a success <b>less</b> likely.</p>
						<p>- When rolling with <em>Advantage</em> you roll <b>2</b> <em>d20</em> and ignore the <b>higher</b> of the two. The result is the <b>lower</b> of the two rolls. </p>
						<p>- When rolling with <em>Disadvantage</em> you roll <b>2</b> <em>d20</em> and ignore the <b>lower</b> of the two. The result is the <b>higher</b> of the two rolls.</p>
					</section>
					<section id="critical-successes-and-fails-">
					<h3>Critical Successes and Fails </h3>
						<p>Discussed further in <a href="core.html#Ability Checks">ABILITY CHECKS</a>. When the result of a <em>d20</em> roll before modifiers is the minimum (1) it might be considered a <em>Critical Success</em> or maximum (20) it might be considered a <em>Critical Fail</em> . Your table might refer to the result of a roll <b>before</b> modifiers as <em>natural</em> since it hasn't been modified. A roll <b>with</b> modifiers may also be referred to as <em>dirty</em>. A <em>natural</em> 1 is a <em>crit</em>, but a <em>dirty</em> 1 is not.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="specific-beats-general">
				<h2>SPECIFIC BEATS GENERAL</h2>
					<p>There are many rules in the game, but when a specific rule and a general rule conflict the more specific rule takes precedence. TODO replace with a real example from game. For example if the rules say: "You can only take one <em>action</em> on each of your <em>turns</em>." but a class feature your <em>character</em> has says that: "On each <em>turn</em> you may take two <em>actions</em> instead of one." then you can take two <em>actions</em> each <em>turn</em> even though this conflicts with a more general rule. This isn't always so clear and it is up to the <em>GM</em> to decide which ruling takes precedence in each situation. My advice is to be charitable with a rule's triggering context. If you think a scenario <b>might</b> trigger a rule it probably does.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="rounding">
				<h2>ROUNDing</h2>
					<p>TODO if rounding is introduced to the game. Otherwise I can remove. </p>
