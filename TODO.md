# TODO

- Make **bolded text** clearer
- Add a toggleable author's notes
- Create a blog section for updates (just use commit messages?)
- Actually have tabs or 4 space tab :/
- Back button (takes you one level higher, not home)
- Search feature
- ~~Generate home page links using the list of documents in *markdown* **not** the list in *docs*. Tsk tsk.~~
- Fix any TODO in the game.
- Add the ability to hover a **defined** term and see the definition (Advantage, Disadvantage, etc. maybe even dice rolls)
- ~~Fix the underscores appearing in home page links~~
