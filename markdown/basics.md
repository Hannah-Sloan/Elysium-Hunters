# How to play

**Elysium Hunters** is a role-playing game played using your imagination. You play with friends, 5 people is ideal but you can find a way to play with any number of people. **One of you** takes on a special role, the role of the *Game Master*. The rest of you play *Player Characters*. 

​    **Game Master:** Abbreviated as *GM*. The Game Master **plays the world** of Elysium Hunters. They **present** the fictional environments, **and play** the *non-player characters*. They also act as a sort of **referee**, a neutral arbitrator of the rules: **helping** *players* understand how they work and using them in **uncertain moments** to determine what happens.

​    **Player:** Any person playing who is not the *Game Master*. When the game mentions the *players* it is not referring to the *Game Master*. It is important to note that the GM is a player too. They invest their imagination and energy to create an engaging adventure and **everyone at the table deserves to enjoy the game.**

​    **Player Character:** Abbreviated as *PC* . Each *player* controls one fictional characters that they *role-play*, you decide what your character does and **imagine** what they are thinking and feeling. A good *player* allows their character's wants, personality and flaws to inform that character's relationships and actions. A good *player* is brave enough to allow themselves to **imagine, for the duration of the game, that their character is real.**

The *players* and *game master* engage in a **dialogue**: the players describing what they do and the GM describing what happens. Whenever you are uncertain about what happens in the fiction you consult the rules. This back and forth is what makes up a *session*. A typical session lasts **4 hours** (with lots of breaks!) but the ideal session length is the duration that **works best for your group**. Many sessions each continuing the same story are what make a *campaign* should your group want to play a long story. Some campaigns can even last for **years** in the real world!
