# Open Source

This project's code is publicly available here on this Github. The code (Markdown To Html, css, javascript) is Licensed under the MIT License. The game's text and html is **not** licensed under MIT. That means you can use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell this project's code. In other words, you are welcome to fork and clone this game! However, redistributing the project in its entirety or any of the **markdown or html** falls under the Game's CC BY-NC 4.0 License, since the source code *contains* the verbatim text of the RPG. Fortunately, the Game License allows you to copy, remix, transform, and build on the text so long as you **include the attribution statement**. Make sure you **remember this step** when ***forking or cloning*** of the repository!

The hope is this will allow you to easily create **Elysium Hunters hacks**, as well as create *Pull requests* with community suggestions or just improving the code. Though I will retain control of this version of Elysium Hunters it's the **community that will drive it** to be the best it can be. Perhaps a popular fork will completely open source development- containing popular rule variations and homebrew! You could steal the css style and use it to present your homebrew class (see **Third-Party Content** above). This github is meant to **allow you** to do all of that.
